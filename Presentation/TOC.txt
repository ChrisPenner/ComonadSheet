An unexpected journey
(Co)monads: a brief summary
A particular flavor of comonad
Back to Piponi's `loeb`
Fixed that for you
Is this our fix?
Well, sort of...
Sharing is caring (as well as polynomial complexity)
Holding on to the future
Filling in the holes

Will it blend?
Wait just a minute!

Zippy comonads -> zippy computation
Can going fast be total(ly safe)?
But I'm more than a one-dimensional character
Do you want to build a comonad?
Type sleuth vs. the mysterious functor-swapper
Mystery solved
The story so far

Nest it / `fmap` it / quick rewrap it
Drag and drop it / zip - unzip it
He's making a list and checking it statically
Take it / view it / go - insert it
What have we learned?
With great power comes code snippets for a tech talk
