This might be an overly-general instance, because it would conflict with another possible (valid) definition for the composition of two comonads, but which requires constraints we can't satisfy with the comonads we're using. Namely, you can also instantiate this instance if you replace @fmap distribute@ with @fmap sequenceA@ (from @Data.Traversable@), and let the resulting instance have the constraints @(Comonad f, Comonad g, Traversable f, Applicative g)@. Since not all of our comonads in this project are applicative, and no infinite structure (e.g. @Tape@) has a good (i.e. not returning bottom in unpredictable ways) definition of @Traversable@, using the @Distributive@ constraint makes much more sense here.
