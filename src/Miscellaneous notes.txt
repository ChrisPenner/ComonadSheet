quickcheck tests
build out examples
learn/use TH to add dimensions quickly
benchmark versions against each other & benchmark 2 different versions of Comonad-via-Distributive against one another
add more documentation comments to the code
modify Peano code to use GADTs to enforce well-formed numbers
split out HList-y stuff into a new file
combine Take/Window into fully generic Slice class
maybe use existential type wrapper for Abs and Rel to unify before passing into the free applicative
use Cartesian code to implement n-way Cartesian product [aside]
add to/from tuple functions for HList-y stuff and add tuple instances for all the generic functions
add Nil to make base cases simpler
possibly make generic map function for my n-tuples
at, by : tuple -> n-d ref... at is absolute everything, by is relative everything
Nats, lists, refs as gadts
Homogenize/heterogenize (counted?)
Abs needn't be polymorphic
You can't save the asymptotic efficiency of safe evaluate, I think...
